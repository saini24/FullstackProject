By following these steps, you will have a simple Task Management Application that allows users to create, read, update, and delete tasks. This setup uses React for the front-end and Node.js with Express.js for the back-end, connected to a MongoDB database. The application is designed to be responsive and user-friendly.


how to connect front end of that task to backend

To connect the front-end of the Task Management Application to the back-end, you need to set up API calls in the front-end to interact with the RESTful API you created in the back-end. Hereâ€™s a detailed guide on how to achieve this using Axios, a promise-based HTTP client for the browser and Node.js.

Step-by-Step Guide
Install Axios:
Make sure you have Axios installed in your front-end project. If not, you can install it using npm.

bash
Copy code
cd frontend
npm install axios
Set up API calls in the front-end:
Update your front-end components to make API calls to the back-end using Axios.

Update the TaskList component:
Modify TaskList.js to fetch tasks from the back-end and handle adding, updating, and deleting tasks.
